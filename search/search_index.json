Check for all the pre-requisites in the curriculum,    specially previous pharmacometrics knowledge.    Some workshops curricula depend on another workshop curriculum    for the best learning experience,    make sure that your learners can fully enjoy the workshop you are planning.    Finally, all of the workshops curricula have learning personas,    learning objectives, teaching notes, and timetables.    For the best experience, we recommend following them.</li> <li> Clone the desired workshop template repository by clicking the    GitHub green button \"Use this template\".    This will create a copy of the workshop template as your personal repository.    We don't recommend additions or modifications to the curriculum,    except for changing the data files examples.</li> <li> Rehearse at least once with the curriculum timetables to build confidence    and also make sure that the workshop will be properly conducted.    Check the teaching notes to avoid common pitfalls    while conducting the workshop.</li> <li> Arrange for all required materials and equipment.    If your workshop is virtual provide an online meeting platform    with the required capabilities for screen sharing and    attendees participation.    If your workshop is on premises provide the space, seating,    and any other necessary equipment such as projectors    to the execution of the workshop;    don't forget to plan for coffee breaks with beverages and food.    If you plan to record your workshop, either virtual or on premises,    make sure you have the consent for all attendees, and,    if necessary the hosting institution.</li> <li> Email learners with instructions on how to have access to Pumas,    installation procedures, and any other requirements such as    downloading data and code.    Additionally, users should be aware of the Code of Conduct    and abide by it at all times not only during the workshop,    but in any related activities.</li> <li> Keep close contact with learners by reminding them about deadlines,    and emailing them a couple days before the workshop to remind them    about any requirement.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#get-in-touch","title":"Get in touch","text":"<p>If you have any suggestions or want to get in touch with our education team, please send an email to training@pumas.ai.</p>"},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<p>This content is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.</p> <p></p>"}]}
